abstract="Robots and drones have recently become commonplace, with more advanced and affordable units available every year. While initially they may have been marketed primarily to hobbyists, consumer robots (and drones in particular) have become much more than just toys; they have garnered more and more attention from researchers across fields such as environmental sensing, surveillance, computer vision, machine learning, systems engineering, and networking. Robots and drones provide a rich playground in which to tackle challenging problems aimed at increasing the autonomy of machines. Moreover, as these machines become ever more ubiquitous, there arises both the desire and need to provide a way for them to coordinate their movements and actions so that they can accomplish tasks such as navigating without collision or mapping an area. Such coordination becomes more difficult once the space that must be navigated is in a GPS-denied area. In this chapter, the many facets of robot and drone coordination in GPS-denied areas are discussed, addressing issues associated with localization and coordinating multiple agents as they attempt to accomplish a common goal.",

ABSTRACT = {The search for a unique and globally available location solution has attracted researchers for a long time. However, a solution for indoor scenarios, where high accuracy is needed, and Global Positioning System (GPS) is not available, has not been found yet. Despite the number of proposals in the literature, some require too long a calibration time for constructing the fingerprinting map, some rely on the periodic broadcast of positioning information that may downgrade the data communication channel, while others require specific hardware components that are not expected to be carried on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) wireless devices. The scalability of the location solution is another key parameter for next-generation internet of things (IoT) and 5G scenarios. A passive solution for indoor positioning of WiFi devices is first introduced here, which merges a time-difference of arrival (TDOA) algorithm with the novel fine time measurements (FTM) introduced in IEEE 802.11mc. A proof of concept of the WiFi passive TDOA algorithm is detailed in this paper, together with a thorough discussion on the requirements of the proposed algorithm.},

This paper presents an autonomous robot making the construction of a radio signal mapping, by collecting and forwarding different useful information related to all access point devices and inherent to the robot towards the base station. A real case scenario is considered by measuring the RF field from our department network. The RF signal mapping consistency is shown by fitting the measurements with the radio signal strength model in two-dimensional area, and a path-loss exponent of 2.3 is estimated for the open corridor environment.}

abstract = {Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning techniques are based on precise but ambiguous carrier phase observations. The ambiguities can be resolved by properly modelling the ionospheric influence. However, under perturbed ionospheric conditions, the ionospheric modelling may become inaccurate and thus lead to degraded network performance. Generally, the ionospheric impact is noticeably stronger during ionospheric storms and perturbations, which raises the question of how the GNSS reference networks perform, in terms of integrity and reliability, during such unfavourable conditions. For the purpose, potential problems of reference network concepts that can be attributed to ionospheric interference are addressed here. In particular, the ionospheric impact on the residual error in reference networks is analysed, and some preliminary results are presented. Case studies of ionospheric storms clearly show the development/propagation of ionospheric disturbances and associated effects on positioning inaccuracies. Also studied is the feasibility of operational space weather monitoring services for mitigating the ionospheric impact and improving the performance of reference networks.}

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous driving is becoming a pivotal technology that can realize intelligent transportation and revolutionize the future of mobility. Various types of sensors, including perception sensors and localization sensors, are essential for high-level autonomous and intelligent vehicles (AIV). In this paper, the characteristics of different sensors are compared, and the application characteristics and requirements of AIV are analyzed in depth. These analyses indicate that: GNSS, as the unique localization sensor that can obtain an absolute position, can not only provide all-weather position and time information for internal multi-sensor fusion but also act as a standard spatiotemporal reference for all autonomous systems; Furthermore, AIVs aim to provide safety for a mass user base ranging from tens to hundreds of millions; for this, AIVs require a global wide-area and instantaneous precise positioning service with location privacy protection. Based on a “geometry-bound” description of road grade and vehicle size, it has been found that GNSS requirements in autonomous vehicles include decimeter-level positioning with the assurance of high integrity. Combined with high-integrity GNSS implementation in the civil aviation field, GNSS different technology routes, and commercial solutions, a state space representation (SSR)-based GNSS high-precision augmentation positioning solution for AIV is summarized and introduced. The solution can achieve instantaneous, precise positioning with high integrity in a wide area by utilizing passive positioning mode with location privacy protection. In addition, the research progress on key technologies in the solution and existing challenges is investigated in detail by reviewing a series of publications.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we developed a low-cost, high-precision vehicle navigation system for deep urban multipath environments using time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) measurements. Although many studies are being conducted to navigate autonomous vehicles using the global positioning system (GPS), it is difficult to obtain accurate navigation solutions due to multipath errors in urban environments. Low-cost GPS receivers that determine the solution based on pseudorange measurements are vulnerable to multipath errors. We used carrier phase measurements that are more robust for multipath errors. Without correction information from reference stations, the limited information of a low-cost, single-frequency receiver makes it difficult to quickly and accurately determine integer ambiguity of carrier phase measurements. We used TDCP measurements to eliminate the need to determine integer ambiguity that is time-invariant and we combined TDCP-based GPS with an inertial navigation system to overcome deep urban multipath environments. Furthermore, we considered a cycle slip algorithm for its accuracy and a multi-constellation navigation system for its availability. The results of dynamic field tests in a deep urban area indicated that it could achieve horizontal accuracy of at the submeter level.},

ABSTRACT = {The growing possibilities offered by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in many areas of life, in particular in automatic data acquisition, spur the search for new methods to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the acquired information. This study was undertaken on the assumption that modern navigation receivers equipped with real-time kinematic positioning software and integrated with UAVs can considerably improve the accuracy of photogrammetric measurements. The research hypothesis was verified during field measurements with the use of a popular Enterprise series drone. The problems associated with accurate UAV pose estimation were identified. The main aim of the study was to perform a qualitative assessment of the pose estimation accuracy of a UAV equipped with a GNSS RTK receiver. A test procedure comprising three field experiments was designed to achieve the above research goal: an analysis of the stability of absolute pose estimation when the UAV is hovering over a point, and analyses of UAV pose estimation during flight along a predefined trajectory and during continuous flight without waypoints. The tests were conducted in a designated research area. The results were verified based on direct tachometric measurements. The qualitative assessment was performed with the use of statistical methods. The study demonstrated that in a state of apparent stability, horizontal deviations of around 0.02 m occurred at low altitudes and increased with a rise in altitude. Mission type significantly influences pose estimation accuracy over waypoints. The results were used to verify the accuracy of the UAV’s pose estimation and to identify factors that affect the pose estimation accuracy of an UAV equipped with a GNSS RTK receiver. The present findings provide valuable input for developing a new method to improve the accuracy of measurements performed with the use of UAVs.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, a comparative study between an Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) localization system and a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm is presented. Due to its high bandwidth and short pulses length, UWB potentially allows great accuracy in range measurements based on Time of Arrival (TOA) estimation. SLAM algorithms recursively estimates the map of an environment and the pose (position and orientation) of a mobile robot within that environment. The comparative study presented here involves the performance analysis of implementing in parallel an UWB localization based system and a SLAM algorithm on a mobile robot navigating within an environment. Real time results as well as error analysis are also shown in this work.},

ABSTRACT = {This research article proposes a novel ray-launching propagation loss model that is able to use an environment model that contains the real geometry. This environment model is made by applying a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm. As a solution to the rising demands of Internet of Things applications for indoor environments, this deterministic radio propagation loss model is able to simulate an accurate coverage map that can be used for localization applications or network optimizations. Since this propagation loss model uses a 2D environment model that was captured by a moving robot, an automated validation model is developed so that a wireless sensor network can be used for validating the propagation loss model. We validated the propagation loss model by evaluated two environment models towards the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the Mean Error (ME). Furthermore, the correlation between the number of rays and the RMSE is analyzed and the correlation between the number of reflections versus the RMSE is also analyzed. Finally, the performance of the radio propagation loss model is analyzed.},

abstract = {Path planning is one of the most important problems to be explored in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for finding an optimal path between source and destination. Although, in literature, a lot of research proposals exist on the path planning problems of UAVs but still issues of target location and identification persist keeping in view of the high mobility of UAVs. To solve these issues in UAVs path planning, optimal decisions need to be taken for various mission-critical operations performed by UAVs. These decisions require a map or graph of the mission environment so that UAVs are aware of their locations with respect to the map or graph. Keeping focus on the aforementioned points, this paper analyzes various UAVs path planning techniques used over the past many years. The aim of path planning techniques is not only to find an optimal and shortest path but also to provide the collision-free environment to the UAVs. It is important to have path planning techniques to compute a safe path in the shortest possible time to the final destination. In this paper, various path planning techniques for UAVs are classified into three broad categories, i.e., representative techniques, cooperative techniques, and non-cooperative techniques. With these techniques, coverage and connectivity of the UAVs network communication are discussed and analyzed. Based on each category of UAVs path planning, a critical analysis of the existing proposals has also been done. For better understanding, various comparison tables using parameters such as-path length, optimality, completeness, cost-efficiency, time efficiency, energy-efficiency, robustness and collision avoidance are also included in the text. In addition, a number of open research problems based on UAVs path planning and UAVs network communication are explored to provide deep insights to the readers.}

Resulting areas are assigned among the UAVs, who could cover them using a zigzag pattern. Each UAV has to compute the sweep direction which minimizes the number of turns needed along a zigzag pattern.

abstract = {The collaboration of heterogeneous robots is a hot topic in multi-intelligent agents, characterized by wide-area coverage and high environmental adaptability. Compared with a single-intelligent agent, multi-intelligent agent collaboration presents superior data matching, system redundancy, and robustness. At the same time, the complementarity of heterogeneous multi-robot is formed a cross-domain, which inherently improves its perception capability, execution capability, and operational efficiency in the complex environment. Therefore, multi-intelligent agents’ organic coordination and cross-domain collaboration will lead to a new paradigm of future robotics and applications. This paper reviews air-ground collaboration, the Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) collaborative system as the research targets. Firstly, the essential elements of UGVs and UAVs are introduced. Secondly, the types of equipment, sensors, missions, environments, metrics under heterogeneous robotic platforms, and how to make device selections in which tasks and scenarios are classified. Thirdly, several vital roles in the air-ground collaborative systems are identified. Finally, a multi-level classification of air-ground collaboration in funded projects, competitions, unique scenarios, inspirations, platforms, and challenges is discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles offer a safe and fast approach to the production of three-dimensional spatial data on the surrounding space. In this article, we present a low-cost SLAM-based drone for creating exploration maps of building interiors. The focus is on emergency response mapping in inaccessible or potentially dangerous places. For this purpose, we used a quadcopter microdrone equipped with six laser rangefinders (1D scanners) and an optical sensor for mapping and positioning. The employed SLAM is designed to map indoor spaces with planar structures through graph optimization. It performs loop-closure detection and correction to recognize previously visited places, and to correct the accumulated drift over time. The proposed methodology was validated for several indoor environments. We investigated the performance of our drone against a multilayer LiDAR-carrying macrodrone, a vision-aided navigation helmet, and ground truth obtained with a terrestrial laser scanner. The experimental results indicate that our SLAM system is capable of creating quality exploration maps of small indoor spaces, and handling the loop-closure problem. The accumulated drift without loop closure was on average 1.1% (0.35 m) over a 31-m-long acquisition trajectory. Moreover, the comparison results demonstrated that our flying microdrone provided a comparable performance to the multilayer LiDAR-based macrodrone, given the low deviation between the point clouds built by both drones. Approximately 85 % of the cloud-to-cloud distances were less than 10 cm.},

SpotFi only uses information that is already exposed by WiFi chips and does not require any hardware or firmware changes, yet achieves the same accuracy as state-of-the-art localization systems. SpotFi makes two key technical contributions. First, SpotFi incorporates super-resolution algorithms that can accurately compute the angle of arrival (AoA) of multipath components even when the access point (AP) has only three antennas. Second, it incorporates novel filtering and estimation techniques to identify AoA of direct path between the localization target and AP by assigning values for each path depending on how likely the particular path is the direct path. Our experiments in a multipath rich indoor environment show that SpotFi achieves a median accuracy of 40 cm and is robust to indoor hindrances such as obstacles and multipath.},

               array calibration, mapping and positioning using UWB and mapping
               and positioning using round-trip-time measurements between

               propose a novel hypothesis and test framework that efficiently
               finds initial estimates of the unknown parameters and combine
               such methods with optimization techniques to obtain accurate and
               robust systems. The proposed systems are evaluated using Wi-Fi
               round-trip time measurements to give a realistic example of
               indoor localization. The resulting map of the anchor points is
               validated against ground truth measurements with promising
